        "\n",
        "This section provides a step by step guide on how to containerize your FastAPI application using Docker and test it locally. Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container, ensuring that your application runs consistently across different environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of This Example\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goal is to demonstrate the process of creating a Docker image for your FastAPI application and running it as a container for local testing. This is a crucial step before deploying your application to production environments. It covers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Project Preparation:** Ensuring your project directory is correctly structured with all necessary files for Docker to build the image.\n",
        "2.  **Building the Docker Image:** Using the `docker build` command to create a portable image of your application.\n",
        "3.  **Running the Docker Container:** Launching your application inside a Docker container, mapping necessary ports to access it from your host machine.\n",
        "4.  **Local Testing:** Verifying that your FastAPI application is accessible and functional within the Docker container.\n",
        "5.  **Cleanup Best Practices:** Instructions on how to stop and remove containers and images to manage resources effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process is fundamental for achieving reproducibility and consistency in your application deployments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "Before proceeding, ensure you have Docker installed and running on your local machine. You can download Docker Desktop from the official Docker website.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step by Step Guide for Local Docker Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1: Prepare Your Project Directory**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensure that all the files and directories mentioned in your Dockerfile are present in the same directory as your Dockerfile. This is crucial because the `COPY` commands rely on these files existing in the \"build context\" (the directory where your Dockerfile resides).\n",
        "\n",
        "You should have the following files/directories in your project root:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Dockerfile` (the definition of your Docker image)\n",
        "-   `requirements.txt` (listing Python dependencies like `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `mlflow`, `pandas`, etc.)\n",
        "-   `app.py` (your main FastAPI application file, or `app_flexible.py` if you used that name in the previous step)\n",
        "-   A directory named `src/` (containing `config.py` and other modules, if your project structure includes it)\n",
        "-   A directory named `model_store/` (containing your trained model, e.g., `churn_prediction_model_v1.joblib` or any other model artifact your `app.py` loads).\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure your current working directory in your terminal is the one containing all these files.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2: Build the Docker Image**\n",
        "\n",
        "This command reads your `Dockerfile` and creates a Docker image, which is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",
        "-   Navigate to the directory where your `Dockerfile` is located.\n",
        "-   Run the following command:\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    docker build -t churn-fastapi-app .\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    * `docker build`: This is the command to build a Docker image.\n",
        "    * `-t churn-fastapi-app`: This tags your image with a name (`churn-fastapi-app`). You can choose any meaningful name. This name will be used to reference the image later.\n",
        "    * `.`: This specifies the build context, meaning Docker will look for the `Dockerfile` and all referenced files in the current directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will see output in your terminal as Docker executes each step defined in your `Dockerfile`. If successful, it will end with a message indicating the image was built.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3: Run the Docker Container**\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the image is built, you can run a container from it. A container is a running instance of an image.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   In your terminal, run the following command:\n",

        "    docker run -p 8000:8000 --name churn-fastapi-app-instance churn-fastapi-app\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    * `docker run`: This command starts a new container.\n",
        "    * `-p 8000:8000`: This is crucial for local testing. It maps port `8000` on your host machine (your computer) to port `8000` inside the Docker container. Your `Dockerfile` exposes port `8000`, and your `CMD` command runs Uvicorn on port `8000` inside the container. This mapping allows you to access the app from your browser.\n",
        "    * `--name churn-fastapi-app-instance`: This gives your running container a memorable name (`churn-fastapi-app-instance`). This is optional but very useful for stopping or removing it later. You can use `docker ps` to see running containers and their names/IDs.\n",
        "    * `churn-fastapi-app`: This is the name of the Docker image you built in Step 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "The application will start running inside the container, and you should see Uvicorn's output in your terminal, indicating it's listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 4: Test Your FastAPI Application**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that your container is running, you can access your FastAPI application from your web browser or using tools like `curl`.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "This will show you all your defined API endpoints and allow you to test them directly from the browser using Swagger UI.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 5: Stop and Clean Up (Good Practice)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you've finished testing, it's good practice to stop and remove the container to free up resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **To stop the container:**\n",
        "    * If you ran it in the foreground (without `-d`), go back to your terminal where the container is running and press `Ctrl+C`.\n",
        "    * Alternatively, if you ran it in detached mode (with `-d`) or in another terminal: `docker stop churn-fastapi-app-instance` (Replace `churn-fastapi-app-instance` with your container's name or ID from `docker ps`).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **To remove the container (after stopping):**\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    docker rm churn-fastapi-app-instance\n",
        "    ```\n",

        "\n",
        "To deploy CI/DC on GitHub the following configurations are needed:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Establish a GitHub repository\n",
        "- Create Your Workflow File: Create a new directory at the root of your repository called `.github/workflows`. Inside this directory, create a new `YAML` file. The name of this file will be the name of your workflow (e.g., `ml_pipeline.yml`, `model_deploy.yml`). This file is where you define the entire CI/CD process. E.g.,\n",
        "\n",
        "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define Workflow Triggers (`on`): Within your YAML file, the first thing to configure is when the workflow should run. Example:\n",
        "    - on: `push`: The workflow runs every time code is pushed to the repository (you can specify branches, e.g., branches: [main]).\n",
        "    - on: `pull_request`: The workflow runs when a pull request is opened, synchronised, or re-opened.\n",
        "    - on: `schedule`: You can set it to run at specific intervals, for instance, daily at a certain time to retrain a model.\n",
        "    - on: `workflow_dispatch`: Allows for manual triggering from the \"Actions\" tab.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define Jobs (`jobs`): Workflows are made up of one or more \"jobs.\" Each job runs on a separate virtual machine (called a \"runner\"). You'll define distinct jobs for different phases of your pipeline, e.g., `data_preprocessing`, `model_training`, `model_testing`, `model_deployment`. You specify the operating system for the runner, e.g., `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define Steps within Jobs (`steps`): Each job consists of a sequence of \"steps.\" These steps are individual tasks that are executed in order. Common Steps for ML CI/CD:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Checkout Code: Use the `actions/checkout@v4` Action to get your repository's code onto the runner.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Set up Environment: Use `actions/setup-python@v5` to configure the Python version required.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Install Dependencies: Run commands like `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Run Scripts: Execute your Python scripts for data loading, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation (e.g., `python src/train_model.py`).\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Run Tests: Execute unit tests, integration tests, and model performance tests (e.g., `pytest`).\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Build/Push Docker Images: If you're containerising your model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Monitor Your Pipeline: Once configured, commit your YAML file to the repository. The workflow will trigger based on your defined `on` events. Go to the \"Actions\" tab in your GitHub repository. Here, you will see a list of all your workflow runs, their status (success, failure, in progress), and detailed logs for each step. This is your primary dashboard for observing the CI/CD process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here below an example of the YAML file for our project.\n"
